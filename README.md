# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Java GUI application where two players go head-to-head in a friendly game of Tic-Tac-Toe! The program asks both players to input their names, then explains what the rules of the game are. Included in the game's functionality is a restart button, in case players wish to restart the game. The application has been coded to handle four specific cases: 
- Win (upon a player winning, the screen should turn __)
- Loss (there is no explicit loss message, as it is assumed that if one player won then naturally the other player lost)
- Tie (there will be a message which displays this)
- Restart (resets the game while maintaining the players' names and symbols)
